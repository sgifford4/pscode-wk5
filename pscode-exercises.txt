// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

x = number1
y = number2

input number1
input number2

x + y = number3

print number3



// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

x = number

input number

if number % 2 
	print number is even
else
	print number is odd



// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

count = 0

if count=0
	input number1
	a = number1
	count+1

else if count=1
	input number2
	b = number2
	count+1

else if count=2
	input number3
	c = number3
	count+1

else if count=3
	input number4
	d = number4
	count+1

else if count=4
	input number5
	e = number5
	count+1

else if count=5
	average = a+b+c+d+e/5
	print average
	count+1

else if count=6
	minimum(number)
	maximum(number)
	count+1

else if count=7
	print minimum(number)
	print maximum(number)

B is calculating the input of the 5 numbers assigned to variables. C is calculating th minimum entered value, and the maximum entered value, then printing eaching in the next iteration.
